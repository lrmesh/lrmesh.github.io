This network acts like an area-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. The mesh network can also be used to transmit GPS locations or read weather and other telemetry. All of this happens without any external infrastructure â€“ no cell phone towers, no internet. We are growing every day.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://lrme.sh/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://lrme.sh/configuration/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lrme.sh/configuration/index.html</guid><description>Recommended Configuration This section will address a few mistakes new mesh users might make.
Please do not enable MQTT Downlink on the default LongFast Channel this will flood our local mesh with hundreds of nodes in different countries.
Please do not set your message hop limit more than 4 hops.
Please keep communications on the default channel clean as many schools are also experimenting with Meshtastic.
Please enable a fixed GPS location if you are not dynamically updating. We encourage not setting the location to your house or office just somewhere close so other users can see signal propagation.</description></item></channel></rss>
