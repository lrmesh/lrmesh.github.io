Please do not enable MQTT Downlink on the default LongFast Channel this will flood our local mesh with hundreds of nodes in different countries.
Please do not set your message hop limit more than 4 hops.
Please keep communications on the default channel clean as many schools are also experimenting with Meshtastic.
Please enable a fixed GPS location if you are not dynamically updating. We encourage not setting the location to your house or office just somewhere close so other users can see signal propagation.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://lrme.sh/configuration/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
